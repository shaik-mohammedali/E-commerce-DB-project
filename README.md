# E-commerce-DB-project

This project simulates an E-commerce Platform by creating a comprehensive database system using MySQL. The system is designed to manage all aspects of an e-commerce business, including user management, product listings, order processing, inventory tracking, payment handling, and shipping. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how a relational database can support an e-commerce application through efficient and scalable database design.
